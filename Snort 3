# Getting Started with Snort 3

This repository documents my first hands-on experience with **Snort 3** as an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for network security.

## Why Snort 3?

Snort 3 is a major upgrade over previous versions, offering:

- **Better performance** with multithreading
- **Clean Lua-based configuration**
- **Easier rule customization**
- **Modular and flexible design**

## What I Did

### 1. Snort Setup
- Configured Snort 3 in **IDS mode** to monitor network traffic.
- Used a Lua-based config file: `snort.lua`.

### 2. Traffic Simulation
- Launched a **SYN flood attack** against a vulnerable website (within my isolated network environment) to simulate malicious traffic.

### 3. Packet Monitoring
- Used **Wireshark** to monitor the same traffic Snort was analyzing.
- Applied filters to focus on **TCP traffic** for comparison.

### 4. Command Used

```bash
sudo snort -i eth0 -c /etc/snort/snort.lua
